#Cybersecurity Lab

To compliment my business school classes, I'm building a cybersecurity lab on my home network to simulate attacks on two Raspberry Pis.



#TODOs

###Set up Raspberry Pi TCP server and client
Use ZMQ req/rec pattern to send TCP packets through the network.

###Write up introduction for the Wiki. You will need 2 Raspberry Pis to create a client/server relationship for both HTTP and TCP communications.
