#Cybersecurity Lab

To compliment my business school classes, I'm building a cybersecurity lab on my home network to simulate attacks on two Raspberry Pis.



#TODOs

###Set up Raspberry Pi TCP server and client
Use ZMQ req/rec pattern to send TCP packets through the network.

###Create Wiki to document how these experiements go
You know...it would be nice to tell people..ya know. =P
